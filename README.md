This repository contains some university related work I find interesting and worth noting. The repository contains the following:

1. Homeworks : A few short homeworks related to PDEs, 
2. Finding optimal Omega for SOR method in C (LAPACK,BLAS) : Short seminar implementing the search for optimal parameter for SOR method for linear system solving, 
3. Implementation of Powell and Fletcher-Reeves optimization algorithms with few examples in MATLAB : Name is self explanatory, 
4. SC1 (C) : Exercises from the course "0Scientific Calculations 1" where C language along with LAPACK and BLAS packages was used... It contains implementations and examples of various numerical algorithms for different types of problems, 
5. SC2 (MATLAB) : Exercises from the course "Scientific Calculations 2" made in MATLAB... It contains implementations and examples of various numerical algorithms for different types of problems, 
6. Statistics : Two seminars made in the earlier stages of my studies, one individual, and one in collaboration with three other students, 
7. Image restoring - short : Short project where I test various noising and denoising techniques for image restoration, along with convolutaions and deconvolutions, such as motion blur and Wiener filter.
